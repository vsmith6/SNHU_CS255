Respository for coursework from SNHU CS-255 course

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

     The DriverPass project was a fictional system design project for the SNHU CS-255 course.  The fictional company, DriverPass, wanted a new system created that would assist them in their goal of improving the driver's exam scores at the local DMV.  DriverPass team wanted a system that was scalable and able to accomodate future changes in the packagaes that they are offering to their customers.  The DriverPass clients will have the option to take practice Driver's tests, participate in onliine courses, and register for one of three on-the-road driver's training courses. The DriverPass system would feature an interactive user interface, a database, a content management system, and the feature of updates from the local DMV.

What did you do particularly well?

     The creation of the UML diagrams that featured the UML class, UML Sequence, and UML activity of the system seemed to be areas that came naturally to me as they break down the system into real world objects and show how those objects will work together.  Having a background in object-oriented programming was helpful to envision what these documents would look like and what they would contain.  As I have seen UML class diagrams before, the additional learnings on the Sequence and Activity diagrams will add to my current skill set and be something that I can implement in the future. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
     
       The document that I would choose to revise is the Business Requirements Document.  The way that I would improve it is to ask more detailed questions to the customer as far as how they expect the DMV updates to be added to the system.  It seems that there was no detail given on how the DMV updates were to be managed, and if it is even possible to subscribe to updates from a government website. 
       The next question I would ask the client is about the timeframe of the project, as it is extremely brief for the level of detail that is expected in such a short time frame.  I would also want to know the experience level of their IT team in order to have a successful handoff. 
       Another point that I would call out about the Business Requirements Document is the lack of a UI design.  The UI design sketched on paper by the client would be difficult to implement, particularly on a mobile device.  I would suggest a UI/UX expert to participate in the design of the user interface. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

     The user's needs were interrpreted by listening to what they wanted at the given interview session.  The needs were analyzed and placed into the Business Requirements Document in order to understand what the functional and non functional requirements are.  Once these requirements were understood, the use cases and the use case diagram are created in order to show an overall flow of they system and to decide who the actors are that will be using the system or external to the system.  
     The System Design Document details the Use Case Diagram as compared to UML Sequence Diagrams and UML Activity Diagrams, which further refine specific use cases to explain a use case scenario.  The UML Class Diagram outlines the classes that will be necessary to create the objects and explains how the classses interact together as well as how they behave together.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

     When desiging software it is important to understand what the customer wants and how we can help them achieve their goals.  Having the customer involved in the design process is crucial to ensure that their ideas are heard and understood.  It also helps when faced with an issue to have the customer on board in order to make any changes as they are already aware of the process.  The techniques that I would use further are the techniques taught in the System Design Document as I learned a lot of new information about some documents that I have never used before and will really be useful in future endeavors. The ability to convert a customer's idea into documents that outline each use case and visually show a customer what their system will do are very important as a system is not something that is tangible.  A customer often doesn't know a lot about technology and can appreciate the details shown in the documentation. The documens are also important in order to pass on to a development team so that they have an accurate blueprint in order to produce the code and configure the other arcitectural components, such as the web server and database.
